# CFD+AI Journey Progress Tracker

## Overview
- **Start Date:** Jan 27 2026
- **Goal:** Build original PINN contribution in 12 weeks
- **Public Accountability:** (https://x.com/tembluso/status/2016652932263862408?s=20)

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1: Foundations (Target: Jan 27 - Feb 2)
**Goals:**
- [Done] Set up infrastructure (GitHub, Claude Projects, NotebookLM)
- [Done] Understand what a PDE is
- [Done] Solve 1D heat equation with traditional method
- [Done] Read PINN paper (at least abstract + intro + Section 2)
- [Done] First X update posted

**What I Built:**
-Complete set up of claude prohjects, notebooks and habit tracker
-Turned a Pytorch PINN into a my own JAX PINN.

**What I Learned:**
-Basic differences between JAX and Pytorch and why JAX is faster.
-ODEs and PDEs
-Fourier series
-What are PINNs
-How to derive and solve the heat equation
